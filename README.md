*The Cursor for AI-powered learning.*

---

Login â†’ create a **new project** (you enter a learning goal prompt + prefs) â†’ it auto-generates a full curriculum.

Each **"file"** = a day in the curriculum.
Each **"folder"** = a full learning track.
The interface:

* Left: file tree (days)
* Center: content view (rich text learning modules)
* Right: AI chat (context-aware agent)

The AI agent has access to:

* The full curriculum
* The user's logbook (progress + reflections)
* User prefs (goal, time, difficulty, etc.)
* Toolchain (search, scrape, solve, generate)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Initial ICP**

* High schoolers prepping for standardized tests (SAT, ACT, AP)

  * They're stressed, time-poor, and already paying for tutors.

## ðŸ”® **Future ICPs**

* Developers learning tech stacks or prepping for interviews
* College students cramming high-signal topics
* Career switchers leveling up fast
* Language learners sick of Duolingo tier hell
* Hobbyists wanting a structured path to mastery

* AI-generated **explanatory videos** using Remotion
* Search across logbook entries (Typesense)
* Resource quality filters: upvote/downvote AI picks, manual edit mode, summary blurbs
* Prebuilt high-quality curricula for standardized tests and key ICPs (SAT, AP Calc, etc.)
* Modular curriculum: reorder days, insert custom content, skip irrelevant topics
* Low-friction onboarding: instant guest mode, default example track, click-to-pick goals
* Natural AI chat UX: preloaded system prompts ("explain simply", "give practice question", etc.)
* Shareable curriculum and logbook: public pages + one-click exports for virality
* AI chat powered by Vercel AI SDK + LangGraph agent runtime
* Tangent mode: keep a curriculum going forever past the original goal; the AI chat gets a bunch of tools to manage this
